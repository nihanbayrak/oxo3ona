              Elif Zuhal Bayrak, working under the artist name oxo3ona, is a visual artist born in Istanbul and based in Berlin.
oxo3ona explores the tension between comfort and discomfort, testing the emotional limits of the viewer through deliberately unpleasant imagery. Rooted in visual languages of past centuries, the work carries a timeless quality — suspended between eras and resisting clear placement in time.
Originally studying Art History, oxo3ona left her studies in the final year, choosing instead to pursue a direct artistic practice. This academic background continues to inform the work through references to historical aesthetics, symbolism, and classical composition.
Working across photography and videography, oxo3ona seeks to animate moments with the same intention: to preserve, disturb, and communicate. The work does not aim for shock alone, but for meaning — delivered through friction, intimacy, and quiet unease.
