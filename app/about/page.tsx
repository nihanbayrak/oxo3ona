              I am a Berlin based visual artist creating horror and surreal photography, with roots in experimental moving image and sound. My work is inspired by surrealist visions and the quiet violence of dreams: love that belongs to an image, time that refuses to stay still, truth that hides in the dark.

              I approach each project like a staged scene from a film. I develop the concept, design the set, style the characters, and photograph the final frame, often using grain, monochrome, and practical effects to keep the illusion physical. The result is cinematic, haunted, and intimate: portraits that feel like myths, and stories that look back at you.
